# TODO

Matthew
    - bigger blobs move slower
        you'll have to remove player.position and rework camera.target
        to be able to do this because of the way the camera works rn

    - redo camera target / player.position 
        try splitting into multiple blobs first
        when all but one of a players blobs are eaten camera target / player.postion
        messes up and stuff like food attracting also gets bugged.

        also remove player.position since its not needed any more
        but try and figure out what to set the camera target to.

    - auto zoom
    - limit on blob count
    - reabsorb blobs at some point
    - respawn food


    - prevent player from going out of bounds
    - don't spawn enemies in player starting chunk

Arthur
