Splitting:
    -- when eating food, update blob positions properly. don't call spawn_blobs

    -- handle collisions properly

    -- adjust blob positions when food is eaten
    -- smoother movement - lag back effect
  

-- Score counter
-- Food absorb animation
blobs grow individually
bigger blobs move slower
better enemy ai
Special abilities and weapons
biomes

respawn food
main menu
Audio
parasites

limits on splitting
limits on player size
reset player splits eventually like in agario
